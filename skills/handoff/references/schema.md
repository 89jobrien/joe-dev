# HANDOFF Schema Reference

## HANDOFF.yaml

```yaml
project: <name>
id: <prefix> # first 7 chars of project name, used for item IDs
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>

items:
  - id: <prefix>-<n> # sequential integer from 1, no leading zeros, never reuse
    name: <kebab-slug> # immutable after creation
    priority: P0 | P1 | P2 # immutable after creation
    status: open | done | parked | blocked # mutable
    title: <one-line> # immutable after creation
    description: <detail> # immutable after creation, null ok
    files: [<path>] # immutable after creation, omit if empty
    completed: <YYYY-MM-DD> # only when status: done
    extra: # append-only; never edit existing entries
      - date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
        type: note | blocker | decision | discovery | escalation | human-edit
        field: <field-name> # human-edit only: which field was changed
        value: <new-value> # human-edit only: the value set
        reviewed: <YYYY-MM-DD> # set by handoff skill after handon acknowledges it
        note: <text>

log:
  - date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
    summary: <one-liner of what happened>
    commits: [<short-hash>] # optional
```

## Immutability Rules

Only `status` and `extra` may change after creation. For materially changed scope, create a
new item and park the old one.

| Field         | Immutable?                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `id`          | yes                         |
| `name`        | yes                         |
| `priority`    | yes                         |
| `title`       | yes                         |
| `description` | yes                         |
| `files`       | yes                         |
| `status`      | no — only mutable field     |
| `extra`       | append-only                 |
| `completed`   | set once when status → done |

## Priority Guide

| Priority | Meaning                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P0       | Broken, blocked, security, data loss — validate before acting |
| P1       | Known fix, clear scope, safe to execute                       |
| P2       | Safe to delegate, well-understood                             |

## human-edit Entries

When a human directly edits a field in HANDOFF.yaml outside a skill session:

```yaml
extra:
  - date: 2026-04-04
    type: human-edit
    field: status
    value: done
    note: "marked done manually — PR merged out of band"
```

- **Unreviewed** = no `reviewed` field on the entry
- **Acknowledged** = `handon` surfaced it, user confirmed; `handoff` stamps `reviewed: <today>`

## .ctx/HANDOFF.state.yaml

Fully overwritten each session. Never committed.

```yaml
updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
branch: <git branch>
build: clean | failing | unknown
tests: "<N passing>" | "failing: N" | "unknown"
notes: <one-line or null>
touched_files: [<path>] # files modified this session; omit if empty
```

Extend freely with project-specific facts (e.g. `rust_edition`, `open_prs`, `last_deploy`).

## File Layout

| File                                   | Location | Committed | Purpose                 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| `.ctx/HANDOFF.<project>.<base>.yaml`   | `.ctx/`  | yes       | Tasks, items, log       |
| `.ctx/HANDOFF.state.yaml`              | `.ctx/`  | no        | Project snapshot        |
| `.ctx/HANDOFF.md`                      | `.ctx/`  | no        | Generated reference doc |

`.gitignore` must contain:
```
.ctx/*
!.ctx/HANDOFF.*.yaml
```

This ignores all `.ctx/` contents while un-ignoring committed HANDOFF files.

## Naming Convention

- **Root handoff** (cwd == repo root): `.ctx/HANDOFF.<project>.workspace.yaml`
- **Nested handoff** (cwd != repo root): `.ctx/HANDOFF.<project>.<cwd-basename>.yaml`

Where:
- `project` = name from Cargo.toml / go.mod / pyproject.toml, fallback to repo root dir name
- `cwd-basename` = `basename $(pwd)` at time of invocation
