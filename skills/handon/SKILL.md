# handon — Session-Start Handoff Reader

## Overview

Scan the current directory tree for handoff files, parse items by priority, and act:

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| P0 | Validate current state immediately. Report to user. Ask before touching anything. |
| P1 | Execute autonomously. Stop only if scope expands or something unexpected happens. |
| P2 | Delegate to subagents. Cap at 5 concurrent. |

## Steps

### 1. Find handoff file

```bash
handoff-detect          # returns path if exists, expected path + exit 2 if not
```

- Exit 0 → file exists, path printed — read it
- Exit 2 → file missing, expected path printed — offer to create via `/atelier:handoff`
- Exit 1 → not in a git repo — report and stop

If `handoff-detect` is not on PATH, fall back to globbing the repo root for `HANDOFF.*.yaml`.

If invoked from a workspace root (e.g. `~/dev`) with no `.git`, sweep subdirs for
`HANDOFF.*.*.yaml` files instead.

If only a legacy `HANDOFF.md` exists at repo root, read it as freeform. Do not convert unless
asked.

### 2. Read .ctx/HANDOFF.state.yaml

After locating the HANDOFF file, read `.ctx/HANDOFF.state.yaml` from the same repo root if it
exists. Extract `branch`, `build`, `tests`, `notes` and surface them in the triage header:

```
## Handoff Triage — <path/to/repo>

Branch: <branch> | Build: <build> | Tests: <tests>
<notes if non-null>
```

If the file is absent, omit the state line rather than guessing.

### 3. Pull latest state from SQLite

Before parsing the local file, check the local SQLite database for status overrides written
outside this session (e.g. by another tool or a manual update):

```bash
SCRIPT=$(ls $HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/local/atelier/*/skills/handoff/scripts/sync-sqlite.sh \
  2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)
bash "$SCRIPT" --project <project> --query 2>/dev/null
```

For each row returned, if the SQLite `status` differs from the YAML `status`, prefer SQLite and
update the in-memory copy before triaging. Do not write back to HANDOFF.yaml here — that happens
in step 9.

If the script is not found or `sqlite3` is not on PATH, skip and continue with the local file.

### 4. Review on wake

Before triaging by priority, scan all items for unreviewed `human-edit` entries — any `extra`
entry with `type: human-edit` and no `reviewed` field (or `reviewed` is absent).

Surface these first, regardless of item priority:

```
## Review on Wake

- [id] "[title]" — human edited `<field>` → `<value>` on <date>
  <note if present>
```

Do not act on these items automatically. Present to user and wait for acknowledgement before
proceeding to P0 triage. After the user acknowledges, note which items were reviewed —
`/atelier:handoff` will stamp `reviewed: <today>` on those entries at session end.

### 5. Parse items

From `HANDOFF.yaml`: read `items` list directly. Filter to `status: open` or `status: blocked`.
Apply any SQLite overrides from step 3 before triaging.

From `HANDOFF.md`: read the "Known Gaps", "Next Up", "Parked", or "Remaining Work" sections.
Infer priority:
- P0: "broken", "fails", "blocked", "urgent", "security"
- P1: specific file + known fix mentioned
- P2: everything else that's safe

### 6. Triage P0 items

For each P0:
1. Run relevant validation (`cargo check`, `git status`, test run)
2. Report finding to user with current state
3. Ask for go/no-go before acting

Do not proceed to P1/P2 until all P0s are acknowledged by user.

### 7. Execute P1 items

Work through each open P1 without asking. Stop and surface to user when:
- Scope expands beyond what the item described
- Tests fail unexpectedly (not the known failure)
- More than 3 files need changing beyond what was described
- Any destructive operation would be needed

### 8. Delegate P2 items

Dispatch one subagent per P2 item (cap 5 concurrent). Each subagent must:
- Receive explicit `--allowedTools` list
- Verify `git status` is clean before starting
- Commit its own changes
- Report back with result

### 9. Report and update

After all work:

```
## Handoff Triage — <path/to/repo>

P0:
  - [id] [name] "[title]" → [state found] → [action / question]

P1:
  - [id] [name] "[title]" → done | blocked: <reason>

P2:
  - [id] [name] "[title]" → delegated | skipped: <reason>
```

Then update `HANDOFF.yaml`:
- Mark done items `status: done`, add `completed: <today>`
- Add `log` entry for this session (one-liner, prepend to list)
- Upsert all items to SQLite via `sync-sqlite.sh` (see handoff skill step 6)
- Commit: `git add HANDOFF.yaml && git commit -m "docs: update handoff"`

## Edge Cases

**No handoff file found:** Report "No HANDOFF.yaml found in `<path>`." Offer to create one via
`/atelier:handoff`.

**HANDOFF.md only:** Read it, triage as normal, note at end: "Consider migrating to HANDOFF.yaml
for structured triage."

**All items done or parked:** Report clean state, no action needed.

**Blocked item:** Do not attempt. Report the blocker to user verbatim from the `description`
field.
